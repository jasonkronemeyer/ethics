Preface
=======

We've seen an explosion of interest in data ethics. Why now? Well, we
know: fake news, data, and all that. But concern about data ethics
started well before the 2016 election. It started well before Google's
automatic photo tagging misidentified some black people as gorillas.
Concern for data ethics has been growing ever since we first started
talking about data science, and possibly before.

Why indeed? Because data has been integrated into every aspect of our
life: the friends and business connections we're asked to make, the
shopping circulars we receive in the mail, the news we see, and the
songs we've played. Data is collected from us at every turn: every trace
of our online presence, and sometimes even traces of our physical
presence. We've gained some advantages from data, but we've also seen
the damage that the misuse of data has caused. And many of these
concerns were highlighted in multiple reports on data and AI from the
White House including the call to the United States that all training
programs for data science and technology include ethics and security.

It's been great to see people gathering to discuss ethics at events
like [D4G](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/) and
[FAT\*](https://fatconference.org/). It's been great to watch the
lively discussions of ethical principles on the [Data For
Democracy](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/) Slack. And it's been
great to read the many bloggers and commentators writing about ethics.

But what we're still missing is an understanding for how to put ethics
into practice in data as well as the overall product development
process. Ethics really isn't about agreeing to a set of principles.
It's about changing the way you act. To take one very simple example:
it's one thing to say that you should get permission from users before
using their data in an experiment. It's quite another thing to get
permission at web scale. And it's yet another thing to get permission
in a way that explains clearly how the data will be used, and what the
expected consequences are. That's what we need to explore.

It's also important to realize that ethics isn't about a fixed list of
do's and don'ts. It's primarily about having a discussion about how
what you're doing will affect other people, and whether those effects
are acceptable.

That's what this book is all about: putting ethics into practice. That
means making room for discussion, making room for dissent, making sure
that you think through the consequences at every stage of a project, and
much more. What does ethics mean for hiring? How do you teach ethics in
an academic setting? These are all big questions, and not questions that
can be answered in a short book like this, but they're questions that
we need to talk about.

Data science is a team sport and we need you on the team. Given the pace
of technology and evolution of thinking that we expect on data, we
consider this work an iterative project. Just like technology releases
that move from a 0.1 release to a 1.0 release to a 3.1 release, our hope
is that others will contribute new sections and existing sections will
be modified. To enable that, we're making this free for download and
also on [GitHub](https://github.com/oreillymedia/ethics-datascience/) so
it can be a community effort.

Thanks to our reviewers: Ed Felton, Natalie Evans-Harris, Fran√ßois
Chollet, and Casey Lynn Fiesler.
